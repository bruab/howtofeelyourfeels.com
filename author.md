I'm Brian, the guy who wrote this book.

If you want to talk about the book, or any of my other books, or ... honestly, at this point you've read _How To Feel Your Feels_, gotten to the appendices, and typed an address into your browser to get here. I'm down to chat about whatever you want.

Send a message to `htfyf` (at) `briandavidhall.com`.

Look forward to hearing from you.
