I'm Brian, the guy who wrote this book. The best place to learn about me is on my personal websiteâ€”you can start here:

https://briandavidhall.com/about

If you want to talk about the book, or any of my other books, or ... honestly, at this point you've read _How To Feel Your Feels_, gotten to the appendices, and typed an address into your browser to get here. I'm down to chat about whatever you want.

My up-to-date contact info will always live here:

Look forward to hearing from you.
